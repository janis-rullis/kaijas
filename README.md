My homework from 2008 at Web Development course. The task was to create
a website using HTML, JS and CSS.

Tried to capture the **feeling** which I had at that time and place.

## Re-animation in 2018

The project was still working fine. Things I did:

* Finished animations of gulls and dreams. Did not have time to finish that 
back in 2008.
* Replaced copyrighted content with copyright-less.

### Adjusted content for modern devices

* Displays have higher resolution, so in some places content was blurry, stretched 
or small. 
* Replaced flash audio played with HTML5 audio tag.
* Adjusted mobile device experience (with manifest.json) when added to home-screen.
